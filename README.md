# ReDown: RedGIFs download and volume helper extension

After the recent changes from RedGIFs (as of 15th December 2023), you can't right clock and save a video anymore (instead you have to replace the `/watch/<id>` url with `/ifr/<id>`).

This extensions adds a button which links directly to the video (which needs to be **right clicked** and use the save linked content option as before; left-click will open the video (.mp4) in a new tab).

This also adds a simple volume control slider because for some reason this website's media is insanely loud.
It has some nice stuff too like remembering your last set volume level and only keeping track of the loaded ad visible videos.

This process is the same for any local exension.

2. Drag the downloaded crx into the browser window, preferably on the extensions page _(it doesnt work on the new tab page in opera gx for whatever reason)_ \
    If you werent on the extensions page, it will prompt you (below the address bar) that this extension was installed from an unknown source: \

3. Click on "Install" and you are set.

### Why not chrome web store?
- 5$ registration fee
- they remove extensions on a whim, most extensions relating in any way to nsfw content are removed
- fuck google <3
